# Assorted-Python-Projects

## Desc:

The Python projects in this repo are small to medium programs that have been done used as testing grounds for new things I have learned. The purpose of this repo is to store and track my progress over time.

## Project Log:

- **Clock Visualizer:** This program takes in a time as input and generates an image of a 12-hour clock using the Turtle module.
- **Fruit Turn Based Battler:** Text-based endless battler
  - Object oriented design
  - Level and xp systems
- **Movie Critic:** Communicates with the [OMDb API](https://www.omdbapi.com) using the Requests module to pull movie data and decide wether a movie is worth watching
  - JSON parsing
  - Heavy text formatting {for aesthetic purposes}
- **Sort:** Exactyl what it sounds like, a place for me to dump different sorting algorithm implementations
- **Polygon Maker:** Receives a number of sides *n* as inputs and generates a centralized regular polygon of *n* sides with the turtle module
- **Mouse Grapher:** Uses pyautogui to determine the position of the mouse cursos on screen, after collectng a certian number of data points, it graphs the trayectory using pyplot
- **Rotating Square Bypiramid:** Uses the Turtle module to sequentially draw a Rotating Square Bipyramid and give the illusion of rotation
- **Target Game:** Game where the player must guess the angle from the origin and the length of an arrow to land within a randomly generated square using Turtrle graphics
- **GUI Unit Converter:** Unit converter built using TKinter that takes a floating point number and converts it from one unit to another
