# This program takes in the time and transforms it into a clock
# This is the second version of this program.
# Improvements include:
# -divided program into functions for readability
# -user can now choose to repeat the program

# NOTES #
# the program is quite a bit longer now, but it has added functionality and it's easier to modify
# the the redundant part where the input is turned to float and then int again
